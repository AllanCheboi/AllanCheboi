- 👋 Hi, I’m @AllanCheboi, a Senior Investigations Manager at Code for Africa (CfA). I lead a team of Forensic Researcher and Data Analysts at CfA's Investigative Lab (iLAB) and coordinate media relationships through CfA's African Network Centre for Investigative Reporting (ANCIR), a network of Africa’s best muckraking newsrooms, collaborating on cross-border investigations and who pool their resources to build the technnologies and expertise necessary to beat disinformation, influence operations, organised crime and corruption in Afica.

- 👀 I’m an experienced Forensic Data Analyst with a demonstrated history of working on Forensic Research, Data Analytics, Cyber Crime and Traditional Investigation related services. Skilled in the Open Source Investigations Techniques (OSINT) & Intelligence Analysis - Use of open source technologies, tools and databases to research or investigate cases of coordinated disinformation campaigns, influence operations and transnational organised crime. This includes use of digital media & social media to track sources of coordinated disinformation narratives, use of publicly available government databases to track criminal cabals such as Human Trafficking syndicates, Extremism, Environmental criminals, Conduct Anti-Money Laundering investigations and track organised crime across the African continent.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning advanced Machine learning & AI techniques in an investigative setting, with an aim of solving the challenges we have on our information environment e.g. the media and social media.

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on development of solutions to investigating disinformation, coordinated inauthentic behaviour and influence operations.
